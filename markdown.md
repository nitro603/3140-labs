## Part 1 reflection
I wasn't able to get bash fully installed in time for this assignment but nonetheless, it seems like a very useful tool from what I've seen. If statements remained mostly the same between the two, and as an interperted language there is no need to compile unlike Java. With bash there's no need to add more libraries, I believe that it could be down just using
the base file. 

## Part 2 reflection 
Again I wasn't able to get bash installed but, I did get to work with makefile and look at some bash examples. I can see why make is such a popular tool nowadays, it's very easy to
get started with and it's efficient at creating command line shortcuts. Instead of having to remember how to run your program or if your program is entirely over the command line
all you have to do is type the associated name you created for it and it'll run. 

## Part 3 reflection
This was an interesting project to work on, before this I'd never worked directly with data the way I did on this lab. If working as a data scientist is similar to this, I think I'd
enjoy it. Sifting, sorting, filtering through data and coming to conclusions based on trends in information was enjoyable. As for my team, We mostly met on weekends through discord to discuss the project which worked nicely because no one had plans, so we discussed who did what and stayed to helped each other at any roadblock if they needed it.
